Immutable NoSQL database that works on a single plain text file

## Features

- **Information is never lost**. Even if you make updates or deletions, you will be able to recover any information at any time.
- There are **no restrictions on the data structure or columns**, since dictionaries are used without limitations on nesting. Similar to MongoDB Documents.
- All the information is **stored in a JSON file**.
- Extremely fastb since it has no queue or locking limitations.
- **Minimalistic** to implement and use.

## Advantages of using an immutable database

- **High level of consistency and accuracy of data**, such as a hospital patient's chronology or banking data. It cannot be modified once it has been aggregated.
- They **simplify the process of backing up and restoring data**, because you can always **revert to the original version** of the data if necessary.
- **Very secure**, modifying existing data will be detected and rejected.
